What is Object ?

~ A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method).
   For example: car, pen, bike, chair, glass, keyboard, monitor etc.

~ JavaScript is an object-based language. Everything is an object in JavaScript.

~ JavaScript is template based not class based. Here, we don't create class to get the object. But, we direct create objects.

    body
