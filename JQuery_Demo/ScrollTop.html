        <p id="tex">Simply put, a paragraph is a collection of sentences all related to a central topic, idea, or theme.
            Paragraphs act as structural tools for writers to organize their thoughts into an ideal progression, and
            they also help readers process those thoughts effortlessly. Imagine how much harder reading and writing
            would be if everything was just one long block of text.

            There’s a lot of flexibility when it comes to writing paragraphs, but if there’s one steadfast rule, it’s
            this: Paragraphs should relate to one main topic or point. The paragraph itself often contains multiple
            points spanning several sentences, but they should all revolve around one core theme. Just as sentences
            build upon each other to communicate the paragraph’s core theme, paragraphs work together to communicate the
            core theme of the writing as a whole.

            That’s the basic idea, but in practice there’s more to it. Let’s look at the four main types of paragraphs
            to learn how and when to use them.
            Expository paragraphs
            Essays, academic papers, and journalistic articles mainly use expository paragraphs to thoroughly explain an
            individual point. These paragraphs rely on data, statistics, or citations from other sources to present
            facts and build up to an irrefutable conclusion.

            Descriptive paragraphs
            Common in fiction and certain styles of journalistic or other nonfiction writing, a descriptive paragraph
            contains various details of the same thing, with each sentence adding new insight. A paragraph in a horror
            novel might describe how it feels walking around the woods alone; a love letter’s paragraph might focus on
            the details of your significant other’s eyes. No matter the context, descriptive paragraphs are meant to
            provide the clearest picture of your subject.

            Persuasive paragraphs
            For editorials and opinion pieces, persuasive paragraphs are meant to convince the reader of a specific
            point, with each sentence presenting evidence or reasoning to support that point. Like expository
            paragraphs, persuasive paragraphs may contain data and statistics, but here, these work to support an
            opinion rather than verify a fact. The trick to writing persuasive paragraphs is knowing how to assert your
            opinion without sounding preachy. </p>
